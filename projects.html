				<p>Jack Torrance’s new job at the Overlook Hotel is the perfect chance for a fresh start. 
					As the off-season caretaker at the atmospheric old hotel, he’ll have plenty of time 
					to spend reconnecting with his family and working on his writing. But as the harsh 
					winter weather sets in, the idyllic location feels ever more remote . . . and more 
					sinister. And the only one to notice the strange and terrible forces gathering around 
					the Overlook is Danny Torrance, a uniquely gifted five-year-old.</p>

				<p>Writer Ben Mears has returned to his hometown of Jerusalem's Lot with the hope that 
					moving into a delapidated mansion, might help him get a handle on his life and provide inspiration for a new book. But when two young boys 
					venture into the woods and only one comes out alive, Mears begins to realize that 
					there may be something sinister at work.
					In time, he comes to understand that his hometown is under siege from forces of darkness 
					far beyond his wildest imagination. And only he, with a small group of allies, can hope to contain 
					the evil that is tearing the town apart.</p>

				<p>They were seven teenagers when they first stumbled upon the horror. Now they are 
					grown-up men and women who have gone out into the big world to gain success and 
					happiness. But the promise they made 28 years ago calls them reunite in the same 
					place where, as teenagers, they battled an evil creature that preyed on the city's 
					children. Now, children are being murdered again, and their repressed memories of 
					that terrifying summer return as they prepare to once again battle the monster 
					lurking in Derry's sewers.</p>
